	<h1>History of Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</h1>
	<div>
		<section id="p1">
			<p id="histo1">
				In the early days of the Web, designers complained that they didn't have enough control over how their pages looked. They wanted to change fonts and colors, and the alignment of text. For years after Sir Tim Berners-Lee first created the World Wide Web in 1989, there was no such thing as CSS. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) was created to help designers separate style from structure of an HTML document. CSS adds the style and design to a web page. The term cascading comes from the ability to combine multiple CSS files to determine the style for one page.

				In 1992, Pei Wei developed a browser called Viola, which had its own style sheet language. In January 23, 1993, NCSA Mosaic was released, making the web more popular than ever, but it only offered limited capability to change fonts and colors. In October 1994, Hakon Wium Lie released the first draft of “Cascading HTML Style Sheets”. In May 1995, the discussion on www-style mailing list was created and influenced the development of CSS and later HTML was removed from the name. In August 1996, Microsoft Internet Explorer became the first browser to support CSS. Netscape followed suit in supporting CSS, but also implemented an alternative Javascript Style Sheets.

				In December 1996, CSS Level 1 (W3C Recommendation) was relesed. CSS 1 supported: font properties, text attributes, alignment of text, tables, images and more, colors of text and backgrounds, spacing of words, letters and lines, margins, borders, padding and positioning, and unique identification and classification of groups of attributes. In May of 1998, CSS 2 (W3C Recommendation) was released, which added new capabilities including z-index, media types, bidirectional text, absolute, relative and fixed positioning, and support for aural style sheets. June 2011 that W3C released CSS 2.1, which fixed errors and aligned the capabilities better with browser functions.

				Not long after, CSS3 was released and capabilities broken into modules. Between June 2011 and June 2012, the following four modules were released as formal recommendations: color, selectors level 3, namespaces and media queries.
