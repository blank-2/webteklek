Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
 > Language used to specify the presentation (eg. layout formatting, font colors etc.) or structurally marked up documents (eg. HTML,XML,SVG, METAML etc.)
 > It is developed by Hakon Wium Lie (CSS) and Bert Bos(SSP)
 
HTML StyleSheets
  -the sources of stules for HTML documents
    > Author Styles
      -external (a.k.a linked) stylesheets 
          An external style sheet is a separate file where you can declare all the styles that you want to use on your website. You then            link to the external style sheet from all your HTML pages.
      -embedded (a.k.a internal) stylesheets
          An internal stylesheet holds the CSS code for the webpage in the head section of the particular file. This makes it easy to             apply styles like classes or id's in order to reuse the code. The downside of using an internal stylesheet is that changes to the         internal stylesheet only effect the page the code is inserted into
      
      -Inline Styles
          The Inline style is specific to the tag itself. The inline style uses the HTML "style" attribute to style a specific tag. This           is not recommended, as every CSS change has to be made in every tag that has the inline style applied to it. The Inline style is           good for one an individual CSS change that you do not use repeatedly through the site.
