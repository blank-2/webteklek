			<p>The world wide web is invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist that was born in London. He invented the web in
1989 while working at CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) a world-class fundamental physics research organization in Europe. Sir Tim Berners-Lee is also the director of the world wide web consortium, founded in 1994. The world wide web consortium is a global web standards organization to lead the web to it's full potential.</p>
