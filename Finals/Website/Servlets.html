				<b>JAVA Servlets</b>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Java objects that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications.</li></p>
					<li><p>Handles client request by generating responses to such requests.</li></p>
					<li><p>Part of the JAVA EE Specification. Click <a href="http://www.etc-graz.at/typo3/fileadmin/user_upload/ETC-Hauptseite/Menschenrechte_lernen/POOL/UDHR_Short_version.pdf">Java Servlet API</a> for additional notes.</li></p>
					<li><p>Hosted in “servlet container that provides the environment in which the servlet runs, as well as controls the “Servlet Lifecycle".</li></p>
				</ul>

				<b>What are JAVA Servlets?</b>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Java Servlets are programs that run on a Web or Application server and act as a middle layer between a requests coming from a Web browser or other HTTP client and databases or applications on the HTTP server.</li></p>
					<li><p>Using Servlets, you can collect input from users through web page forms, present records from a database or another source, and create web pages dynamically.</li></p>
					<li><p>Java Servlets often serve the same purpose as programs implemented using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). But Servlets offer several advantages in comparison with the CGI.</li></p>
					<li><p>Advantages</li></p>
					<p><b>1</b>
						- Performance is significantly better.</p>
					<p><b>2</b>
						– Servlets execute within the address space of a Web server. It is not necessary to create a separate process to handle each client request.</p>
					<p><b>3</b>
						– Servlets are platform-independent because they are written in Java.</p>
					<p><b>4</b>
						– Java security manager on the server enforces a set of restrictions to protect the resources on a server machine. So servlets are trusted.</p>
					<p><b>5</b>
						– The full functionality of the Java class libraries is available to a servlet. It can communicate with applets, databases, or other software via the sockets and RMI mechanisms that you have seen already.</p>
				</ul>

				<b>Servlet Tasks</b>
				<ul>
					<ul><li><p>Servlets perform the following major tasks</p></li></ul>
					<li><p>Read the explicit data sent by the clients (browsers). This includes an HTML form on a Web page or it could also come from an applet or a custom HTTP client program.</li></p>
					<li><p>Read the implicit HTTP request data sent by the clients (browsers). This includes cookies, media types and compression schemes the browser understands, and so forth.</li></p>
					<li><p>Process the data and generate the results. This process may require talking to a database, executing an RMI or CORBA call, invoking a Web service, or computing the response directly.</li></p>
					<li><p>Send the explicit data (i.e., the document) to the clients (browsers). This document can be sent in a variety of formats, including text (HTML or XML), binary (GIF images), Excel, etc.</li></p>
					<li><p>Send the implicit HTTP response to the clients (browsers). This includes telling the browsers or other clients what type of document is being returned (e.g., HTML), setting cookies and caching parameters, and other such tasks.</li></p>
				</ul>
				
				<b>Servlet Lifecycle</b>
				<ul>
					<ul><li><p>Phases of Servlet Life Cycle:</ul></li></p>
					<p><b>Servlet Class Loading</b>
						- First phase the a request from the servlet will be received by the container, when this happens, the class will be loaded into memory.</p>
					<p><b>Servlet Class Initialization </b>
						– Second phase is the transformation of the normal class into a servlet class and invoke's the init() method for the ServletContext object to be intialized by the servlet container.</p>
					<p><b>Request Handling</b>
						– Third phase is the fully functioning website ready to handle client's requests. For every request of the client, the service() method is called by initialiazing the request of the client.</p>
					<p><b>Removal from Service</b>
						– Fourth phase all running applications will be stopped by removing the loaded class from memory using the destroy() method.</p>
					<p><b>Finally</b>
						– Servlet is garbage collected by the garbage collector of the JVM.</p>
					
					<ul><li><p>Servlet Life Cycle consists of three methods:</ul></li></p>
						<p><b>public void init(ServletConfig config)</b>
						– Servlet container (e.g., Tomcat or Glassfish) is responsible for loading and instantiating servlets.  It may load and instantiate servlets when it is started, or delay until it determines that the servlet is needed to service a request (usually at the first request to the servlet), this method is invoked only once in the lifecycle of servlet. The servlet container invokes the init(ServletConfig) method of the servlet, providing a ServletConfig object as an argument. It is usually used to read persistent configuration data and initialize costly resource. This ServletConfig object allows the servlet to access initialization parameters for this particular servlet.  These parameters are defined in the web application deployment descriptor file (i.e., “web.xml”), under the servlet's name. So, it is used for one-time initializations, just as with the init() method of applets.</p>
						<p><b>public void service (ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)</b>
						– The service() method of an HttpServlet takes two arguments, an HttpServletRequest object and an HttpServletResponse object that corresponds to the HTTP request and response messages respectively. This method is called once for every client request, the container can’t invoke service() method until init() method is executed. The service() method is the main method to perform the actual task. The servlet container (i.e. web server) calls the service() method to handle requests coming from the client( browsers) and to write the formatted response back to the client. Each time the server receives a request for a servlet, the server spawns a new thread and calls service. The service() method checks the HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and calls doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate. The service () method is called by the container and service method invokes doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate. So you have nothing to do with service() method but you override either doGet() or doPost() depending on what type of request you receive from the client. The doGet() and doPost() are most frequently used methods with in each service request.</p>
						<p><b>public void destroy()</b>
						– This method is invoked once when servlet is unloaded from memory. When the servlet container decides that a servlet should be removed from the container (e.g., shutting down the container or time-out, which is implementation-dependent). This method gives your servlet a chance to close database connections, halt background threads, write cookie lists or hit counts to disk, and perform other such cleanup activities. After the destroy() method is called, the servlet object is marked for garbage collection.</p>
				</ul>
				
				<b>HTTP Servlets</b>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Java service used to handle HTTP Requests and generate (DO GET, DO POST) HTTP responses.</li></p>
					<li><p>Hosted in a web container which is a component in java “application server”. (Apache Tomcat, glass fish, wildfly, oracle web logic etc.)</li></p>
					<li><p>The doXXX() methods:</li></p>
				</ul>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>HTTP Request</th>
						<th>doXXX() method</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>GET</td>
						<td>doGet()</td>
						<td>this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when handling a get request and used to send limited and non-private data.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>PUT</td>
						<td>doPut()</td>
						<td>this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when the client handles FTP operations.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>TRACE</td>
						<td>doTrace()</td>
						<td>this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when the client wants to debug or trace the headers sent.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>DELETE</td>
						<td>doDelete()</td>
						<td>this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when the client wants to remove or delete a documentation or content or the whole web page from the server.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>OPTIONS</td>
						<td>doOptions()</td>
						<td>this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when any request are called by the client.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>POST</td>
						<td>doPost()</td>
						<td>Called by server, via protected service() method to permit a servlet to handle a HTTP POST request.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>HEAD</td>
						<td>doHead()</td>
						<td>Receives a HTTP HEAD request from the protected service() method and handles the request.</td>
					</tr>

				<ul>
					<li><p>Message with a possibly payload.</li></p>
					<li><p>Object representation of the HTTP response generated by the servlet.</li></p>
					<li><p>HTTP representation of HTTP Response generated by the servlet and sent back to requesting client.</li></p>
				</ul>
				
				<b>HTTP Servlet Request</b>
				<ul>
					<li><p>an interface and can extend the servlet request interface.</li></p>
					<li><p>object of the HTTP servlet request is created by the servlet container and then passed to the service method (doGet(), doPost() etc) of the servlet.</li></p>
