Server-Side Web Scripting

JAVA Servlets
Java objects that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications
Handles client request by generating responses to such requests
Part of the JAVA EE Specification (See Java Servlet API for more details…)
Hosted in “servlet container that provides the environment in which the servlet runs, as well as controls the “Servlet Lifecycle” …

Servlet Lifecycle					
Four phases of Servlet Life Cycle:
					
Servlet Class Loading - First phase the a request from the servlet will be received by the container when this happens, the class will be loaded into memory.
				
Servlet Class Initialization – Second phase is the transformation of the normal class into a servlet class and invoke's the init method for the ServletContext object to be intialized by the servlet container.
				
Request Handling – Third phase is the fully functioning website ready to handle client's requests. For every request of the client the service() method is called by initialiazing the request of the client.
				
Removal from Service– Fourth phase all running application will be stop and removing the loaded class from memory using the destroy() method.
					 					
Servlet Life Cycle consists of three methods:
						
public void init(ServletConfig config) – This method is used by container to initialize the servlet, this method is invoked only once in the lifecycle of servlet.
						
public void service (ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) 		– This method is called once for every request, container can’t invoke service() method until unless init() method is executed.
						
public void destroy() – This method is invoked once when servlet is unloaded from memory

The init() Method
Sample code:

public void init() throws ServletException {
    // load properties from disk, do be used by subsequent doGet() calls
   // Initialization code...
}

The service() Method
Sample code:

public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) 
   throws ServletException, IOException {
}

The destroy() Method

Sample code:

public void destroy() {
   // Finalization code...
}

HTTP Servlets
Java service used to handle HTTP Requests and generate (DO GET, DO POST) HTTP responses.
hosted in a web container which is a component in java “application server”. (Apache Tomcat, glass fish, wildfly, oracle web logic etc.)
The doXXX() methods:

HTTP Request    doXXX() method    Description
GET
doGet()
this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when handling a get request and used to send limited and non-private data.
PUT
doPut()
this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when the client handles FTP operations
TRACE
doTrace()
this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when the client wants to debug or trace the headers sent.
DELETE
doDelete()
this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when the client wants to remove or delete a documentation or content or the whole web page from the server.
OPTIONS
doOptions()
this is a servlet method that is invoke by the server when any request are called by the client.
POST
doPost()
Called by server, via protected service() method to permit a servlet to handle a HTTP POST request.
HEAD
doHead()
Receives a HTTP HEAD request from the protected service() method and handles the request.

HTTP Servlet Response 
Message with a possibly payload.
object representation of the HTTP response generated by the servlet.
HTTP representation of HTTP Response generated by the servlet and sent back to requesting client.


HTTP Servlet Request
an interface and can extend the servlet request interface,
object of the HTTP servlet request is created by the servlet container and then passed to the service method (doGet(), doPost() etc) of the servlet.
