				<b>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</b>
				<p> What is PHP?</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is an open source scripting language and
							the scripts are  executed on the server. PHP can add, delete and modify data in 
							a database and can generate dynamic page content meaning that it contents can be change.</li></p>
					<li><p>PHP files have the extension ".php" that can contain text, HTML, CSS, PHP code and
					Javascript.</li></p>

				<h4>How to connect to the database using PHP</h4>
				<p>This is an example of a MySqli Procedural</p>
				
				<code>
				<pre>
				&lt?php
					$host = 'localhost'; 
					$user = 'root';
					$pass = '';
					$dbname = 'quiz';
	
					$conn = mysqli_connect($host,$user,$pass,$dbname) or die('Cannot connect to the database');
				?&gt
				</pre>
				</code><br>
				
				<li><p>The set of code which has the character dollar sign ($) is a used to create a variable that 
						stores a string value that will be inserted into the mysqli_connect method.</li></p>
				<li><p>This is an optional way to connect to the because the mysqli_connect method also accepts direct 
						string values but for formality's sake it is better to create a variable to represent the value 
						of the parameters this will also help the user determine the value of string it is.</li></p>
				<li><p>The mysqli_connect is the method used in order to connect to the database that is hosted via the wamp server and mySQL. </li></p>
				<li><p>The parameters of mysqli_connect has the following parameters first is the name of the host/server name, second is the username, 
						third is the password then fourth is the database name this parameters are essential but the parameter’s from the first to the 
						third are the basic requirement to connect to the database.</li></p>
				<li><p>The die method is used if the connection to the data fails and the message inside the parameter of the die method will be shown.</li></p>
				
				<h4>How to create a registration form using PHP</h4>
				
				<code>
				<pre>
				&lt?php
					include(‘server.php); 
						if (isset($_POST['register'])) { 
							$name = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['name']);
							$userName = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['username']);
							$password = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['password']);
	
						$sql = "INSERT INTO accounts (name, username, password)
								VALUES ('$name', '$userName', '$password')";
						mysqli_query($conn,$sql);
						}
				?&gt
				</pre>
				</code><br>

				<li><p>For the first line of code include(‘server.php’); this is used to import a php file 
						so that repetition of codes will not happen and it is also used to reuse existing code. </li></p>
				<li><p>Server.php contains the code that will connect to the database and contains the variable $conn which 
				is the connection to the database. Second line is if (isset($_POST['register'])) this is a conditional statement 
				that if the button in the html or php file named register is click this condition will be set into true otherwise 
				false. But in the html or php file we need to specify what kind of method to use either it is a POST method or A 
				GET METHOD.</li></p>
				<li><p>POST VS GET this is an HTTP that request-response or it is a communications between a server and a client. 
				A POST method is an HTTP request method that only sends or update data from the server and A POST method is safest
				HTTP request method when handling sensitive data because it will not have a cache therefore the data of the POST method 
				is safe because the data is posted into the body of the site not into the URL which is not safe. Unlike for the GET method 
				it is the opposite of the POST method where the data being requested is seen into the URL of the website.</li></p>
				<li><p>Third to Fifth line is the used to store the data inputted by the user into a variable. The mysqli_real_escape_string(); 
				is a method used in order to prevent injections to happen by escaping from any special characters</li></p>
				<li><p> It has 2 parameters which is the $conn which is the variable stored by the connection of the to the data via the 
				include(‘server.php’); the other one is the  $_POST[‘username’] this the method from the user which has the method POST and 
				the specified name.</li></p>
				<li><p>The $sql = "INSERT INTO accounts (name, username, password) is an sql code that inserts data into the database with the 
				header name in the database. VALUES ('$name', '$userName', '$password')"; and for this code is for setting the values of of the 
				SQL method that will be inserted into the accounts table.</li></p>
				<li><p>The mysqli_query($conn,$sql); is used to push the sql code into the database with the parameters  $conn which is the connection 
				to the database and if it’s true then the second parameter $sql will execute just like an sql code.</li></p>
