					<tr>
						<th>TOP 10 OWASP</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<th>Example</th>
						<th>Prevention</th>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>1. Injection</td>
						<td>Injection flaws, such as SQL injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. 
							It can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data.</td>
						<td>Bypass the login form w/o providing the valid username and password</td>
						<td>•	Use Parameterized Queries
							•	Use Input Validation</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>2. Broken Authentication</td>
						<td>Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing 
							attackers to assume other users’ identities.</td>
						<td>•	URL Rewriting
							•	Application’s Timeout is not set Properly
							•	Passwords are not properly hashed and salted
							•	Predictable Login Credentials</td>
						<td>•	Password length and complexity
							•	Protection against brute force login</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>3. Sensitive Data Exposure</td>
						<td>Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly 
							protected data. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit. </td>
						<td>•	Credit Card Encryption
							•	SSL is not used for all authenticated pages
							•	Password’s databases uses unsalted hashes to store everyone’s password</td>
						<td>•	Encrypt data during transport and at rest
							•	Minimize Data Surface Area
							•	Use the latest encryption algorithms
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>4. XML External Entities</td>
						<td>External entities in XML can be used to disclose internal files, remote code execution or DDoS attacks</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>5. Broken Access Control</td>
						<td>Attackers can exploit access restriction flaws to access unauthorized functionality and data.</td>
						<td>•	Force Browsing the URL
							•	Horizontal Access Attack</td>
						<td>•	Deny access to functionality by default
							•	Use Access control lists and role-based authentication mechanisms
							•	Do not just hide functions</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>6. Security Misconfiguration</td>
						<td>Use of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, 
						and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.</td>
						<td>•	Default Accounts are not changed
							•	Directory listing is not disabled on your server
							•	App server comes with sample applications that are not removed from your production server</td>
						<td>•	Disable administration interfaces 
							•	Disable debugging 
							•	 Disable use of default accounts/passwords</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>7. Cross-Site Scripting</td>
						<td>Applications use unsanitized user-supplied data in a web page. It allows execution of scripts in the victim’s browser.</td>
						<td>•	Basic Coded Search Engine for a website</td>
						<td>•	HTML escape</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>8. Insecure Deserialization</td>
						<td>Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution, replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation 
						attacks</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>9. Using Components with Unknown Vulnerabilities</td>
						<td>Components, such as libraries, frameworks run with the same privileges as the application. Components with known 
						vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses.</td>
						<td></td>
						<td>•	Manual Updates</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>10. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</td>
						<td>Insufficient logging and monitoring, with missing incident response, prevents rapid reaction and allows continuous 
						probing for vulnerabilities.</td>
					</tr>
