		<h1>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL (HTTP)</h1>
		<section>
			<p>The hypertext transfer protocol (http) is used to access resources like hypertext, hypermedia on the world wide web.</p>
			<p>Jointly developed by the W3C and the IETF (Internet Engineering Task force).</p>
		</section>
			<h3>Version History:</h3>
		<section>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>HTTP 0.9 (for support of basic hypertext documents, 1991)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>HTTP 1.0 (extensions to support rich websites and scalability, RFC 1945, May 1996)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>HTTP 1.1 (developed to address performance limitations of HTTP 1.0, specified in Internet RFC 2068, January 1997)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>HTTP 2.0 (latest version and maintains backward compatibility with HTTP 1.1 but offers additional performance enhancements,
                RFC 7540, May 2015)</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>HTTP Fundamentals:</h3>
		<section id="p5">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>http is based on a client server architecture servers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>uses a request-response standard protocol (the client will send an http request message).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>a "stateless" communication protocol means, the HTTP connection is dropped once the request has been made. Servers do not keep  information about clients in between requests.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
			<h3>HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as:</h3>
		<section>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>cache control</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>language and character set specifications</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>content negotiation allows the client to have preferences</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>content / transfer codings the message can be transmitted in compressed form</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>persistent connections</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>request pipelining / multiplexing</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>authorization and authentication to secure data</p>
				</li>	
			</ul>

		<h1>HTTP Request Message</h1>
		<section>
			<p>Request Line -  begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements    are separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF (Carriage Return, Line Field) sequence.
			<br>
			example:<br>
			Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF </p>
		</section>
		<h3>A request line consists of:</h3>
		<section>
			<p>*Method -  indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the Request-URI and it is case-sensitive.</p>
			<table>
				<caption>Request Methods:</caption>
				<tr>
					<th>Request Methods:</th>
					<th>USES</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>	
					<td>GET</td> 
					<td>most commonly used http method that is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URL</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>	
					<td>POST</td> 
					<td>typically used in submitting HTML form data</td>
				
				</tr>
				<tr>	
					<td>CONNECT</td> 
					<td>creates a tunnel to the server identified by a given URL</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>	
					<td>PUT</td> 
					<td>use to generate data or resources</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>	
					<td>HEAD</td> 
					<td>use to create end to end virtual connections<br>
						similar to the GET Method except that the server does not and must not return a message-body in the response.<br>
						response to head request may be cacheable
					</td>

						responses to this method are cacheable.

		<h1>Content Codings</h1>
		<section>
			<p>Are used to to allow documents to be compressed or usefully transformed without losing the identity of its media type and without loss of info.<br>
  			gzip - it is produced by file compression program "gzip". An encoding format in a Lempel-Ziv coding.<br>
  			compress - the common Unix file compression program "compress" produced this encoding format. An encoding format in a Lempel-Ziv       Welch.</p>
		</section>
		<h1>Transfer Codings</h1>
		<section>
			<p>In order to ensure "safe transport" thorugh the network , values of tranport-codings are used to indicate encoding transformation that has been or can be or may need to be applied to an entity body.</p>
		</section>
		<h1>Chunked Transfer Coding</h1>
		<section>
			<p>It modifies body of messaged in order to transfer it as a series of chunks. It allows content to be dynamically produced to be          transferred along with the information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has received full message.</p>
		</section>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1>HTTP Response Message</h1>
		<section>
			<p>Status Line - consists of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase, with each            element separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF (Carriage Return, Line Field) sequence.<br>
				example:<br>
				Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF
			</p>
			<h4>A status line consists of:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Informational (1xx)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Success (2xx)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Redirection (3xx)</p>

				Http resources are identified using URIs or more specifically, Http URLs.

				<caption>Syntax of URIs (RFC 7230, section 2.7)</caption>

			<p>WEBDav (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Allows clients to perform remote Web content authoring operations.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>RFC 4918</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Some request methods: mkcol, copy, move, lock, unlock, propfind and proppatch.</p>
